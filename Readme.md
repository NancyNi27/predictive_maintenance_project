# Predictive Maintenance Project -- based on CMAPSS dataset

## Project Introduction
This Project implements a predictive maintenance solution using NASA's CAMPSS turbofan engine dataset. By combining AWS cloud service and Power BI visulization, I constructed a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictive system and created an interactive dashboard to support maintenance decisions.

## Technology Stack
** Data Storage: ** AWS S3
** Data Processing: ** Python, Pandas, Numpy
** Machine Learning:  ** TBD
** Cloud Service: **
** Visualization : ** Power BI

## Project Objective
* Analyse sensor data to recognize potential failure patterns
* Construct ML Model to predict equipment remaining useful life
* Develop interactive dashboard for monitoring equipment health status
